# The 2,300 Days of Daniel 8:14
### A Comprehensive Bible Study
**An Adventist Perspective on the Sanctuary, Judgment, and Prophetic Time**

---

> *"Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed."*
> — Daniel 8:14 (KJV)

The prophecy of the 2,300 days stands as one of the most significant time prophecies in all of Scripture. For Seventh-day Adventists, it is foundational — connecting the Old Testament sanctuary service to Christ's high-priestly ministry, the investigative judgment, and the final events of earth's history.

### THE MATH

```
  457 B.C. + 2,300 years = A.D. 1844  (no year zero)
  457 B.C. +   490 years = A.D. 34
  457 B.C. +   483 years = A.D. 27
  A.D.  27 +   3.5 years = A.D. 31  (spring — crucifixion)
  A.D.  31 +   3.5 years = A.D. 34  (autumn — Stephen stoned)

## PART 1: THE VISION OF DANIEL 8

### The Setting
Daniel 8 records a vision given to the prophet Daniel in the third year of King Belshazzar's reign (approximately 550 B.C.). Daniel is transported in vision to the citadel of Susa in the province of Elam.

**Read: Daniel 8:1-4**

> *"In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first. And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam."* — Daniel 8:1-2

### The Ram (Medo-Persia)
Daniel sees a ram with two horns — one higher than the other, with the higher one coming up last. The ram pushes westward, northward, and southward, and no beast could stand before it.

**Interpretation (given by the angel Gabriel):**
> *"The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia."* — Daniel 8:20

- **Two horns** = Media and Persia
- **Higher horn coming up last** = Persia rising to dominance after Media
- **Pushing in three directions** = Medo-Persia's conquests

**Historical confirmation:** Cyrus the Great united Media and Persia in 550 B.C. Persia became dominant under Cyrus (conquering Babylon in 539 B.C.), Cambyses (conquering Egypt), and Darius I (extending to India). The empire spanned from Ethiopia to India (Esther 1:1).

> *Ellen G. White:* "Medo-Persia was to succeed Babylon. The ram that Daniel saw, with its two horns, represented the empire of the Medes and Persians." — *Prophets and Kings*, p. 553

### The He-Goat (Greece)
**Read: Daniel 8:5-8**

> *"And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes."* — Daniel 8:5

A male goat comes from the west with a notable horn between its eyes. It strikes the ram, breaks its two horns, and tramples it. Then the great horn is broken, and four notable horns come up in its place.

**Interpretation:**
> *"And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king. Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power."* — Daniel 8:21-22

- **The goat** = Greece
- **The great horn** = Alexander the Great
- **The four horns** = Four divisions of Alexander's empire (Cassander, Lysimachus, Seleucus, and Ptolemy)

**Historical confirmation:** Alexander the Great conquered Persia at the Battle of Gaugamela (331 B.C.) with astonishing speed ("touched not the ground" — Dan. 8:5). He died in 323 B.C. at age 32, and his empire was divided among his four generals by 301 B.C. (Battle of Ipsus). The historian Josephus records that Alexander was shown this very prophecy in Daniel when he visited Jerusalem (*Antiquities of the Jews*, Book 11, Chapter 8, Section 5).

> *Ellen G. White:* "Philip's son, Alexander... overthrew the armies of Persia and became master of the empire. The youthful conqueror could not rest, and he started out for further conquests." — *Education*, p. 176

### The Little Horn (Rome — Pagan and Papal)
**Read: Daniel 8:9-12**

> *"And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land. And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them. Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down."* — Daniel 8:9-11

Out of one of the four horns comes a "little horn" that grows exceedingly great toward the south, east, and the "pleasant land" (Palestine).

**Key characteristics of this little horn power:**

| # | Characteristic | Verse | Fulfillment |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Grows "exceeding great" — greater than Medo-Persia and Greece | v. 9 | Rome's empire was the largest of the ancient world |
| 2 | Extends toward the south, east, and the pleasant land | v. 9 | Rome conquered Egypt (south), Syria (east), Palestine (pleasant land) |
| 3 | Opposes the "host of heaven" — God's people | v. 10 | Rome persecuted Jews and Christians for centuries |
| 4 | Magnifies itself against the "Prince of the host" — Christ | v. 11 | Pilate (Roman governor) sentenced Christ to death; the papacy claims Christ's authority on earth |
| 5 | Removes the "daily" (tamid) — Christ's continual priestly ministry | v. 11 | Papal system substituted earthly priests for Christ's heavenly mediation |
| 6 | Casts down the "place of His sanctuary" | v. 11 | Pagan Rome destroyed the temple (A.D. 70); papal Rome obscured the heavenly sanctuary |
| 7 | Casts truth to the ground | v. 12 | Introduction of unbiblical doctrines: Sunday worship, purgatory, indulgences, Marian veneration |
| 8 | Practices and prospers | v. 12 | Rome dominated for centuries in both phases |

**SDA Interpretation — Rome in two phases:**

- **Pagan Rome** — Destroyed Jerusalem and the earthly temple (A.D. 70, under Titus — see Josephus, *Wars of the Jews*, Book 6), persecuted God's people, and crucified the "Prince of the host" — Jesus Christ (Luke 23:24; John 19:15-16). *Historical note:* The Roman general Titus destroyed Jerusalem and the temple exactly as foretold by Jesus in Matthew 24:1-2 and Daniel 9:26.

- **Papal Rome** — Substituted a counterfeit system of mediation (the Mass, the confessional, priestly absolution, saints as intercessors) for Christ's continual (*tamid*) high-priestly ministry in the heavenly sanctuary. It "cast truth to the ground" by introducing unbiblical doctrines. The papacy's claims are well documented in papal encyclicals and church council decrees (Council of Trent, 1545-1563).

> *Ellen G. White:* "In the sixth century the papacy had become firmly established. Its seat of power was fixed in the imperial city, and the bishop of Rome was declared to be the head over the entire church. Paganism had given place to the papacy." — *The Great Controversy*, p. 54

**Scripture cross-references for the little horn:**
- Daniel 7:8, 20-25 — The parallel little horn in Daniel 7
- 2 Thessalonians 2:3-4 — "The man of sin... who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God"
- Revelation 13:1-8 — The sea beast with similar characteristics

---

## PART 2: THE QUESTION AND THE ANSWER

### The Holy Ones Speak
**Read: Daniel 8:13-14**

> *"Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot? And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed."* — Daniel 8:13-14

- **The question:** How long will the little horn's oppressive activities continue?
- **The answer:** 2,300 days, then the sanctuary will be cleansed
  - Hebrew: *tsadaq* — "justified," "vindicated," "restored to its rightful state," "made right"
  - The Septuagint (Greek Old Testament) renders it *katharisthesetai* — "shall be cleansed" — the same root used in Hebrews 9:23

> *Ellen G. White:* "The scripture which above all others had been both the foundation and the central pillar of the advent faith was the declaration: 'Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.' Daniel 8:14." — *The Great Controversy*, p. 409

### The Year-Day Principle

In apocalyptic prophecy, a **prophetic day = a literal year**.

**Biblical basis:**
- **Numbers 14:34** — *"After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years."*
- **Ezekiel 4:6** — *"I have appointed thee each day for a year."*

**Why the year-day principle applies here:**
1. The vision spans multiple world empires (centuries, not 6.3 years)
2. Gabriel says the vision concerns "the time of the end" (Daniel 8:17) and "many days" (Daniel 8:26)
3. The Hebrew *ereb boqer* ("evening-morning") recalls creation language (Genesis 1:5, 8, 13) and daily sanctuary sacrifices (Exodus 29:38-39)

**Therefore: 2,300 prophetic days = 2,300 literal years**

> *Ellen G. White:* "An important rule of Bible interpretation is that every word of God, unless there is some good reason for considering it figurative, should be taken in its primary, common sense." — *The Great Controversy*, p. 599. In apocalyptic prophecy, however, symbolic time follows the established year-day principle.

**Historical note:** The year-day principle was recognized by numerous scholars throughout church history, including the Jewish rabbi Nahawendi (9th century), Joachim of Floris (12th century), and the Protestant reformers John Wycliffe, Martin Luther, and Sir Isaac Newton.

## PART 3: THE CONNECTION TO DANIEL 9 — THE KEY TO THE STARTING DATE

### Daniel's Confusion and Gabriel's Return
**Read: Daniel 8:26-27**

> *"And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it shall be for many days. And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood it."* — Daniel 8:26-27

At the end of Daniel 8, Daniel is sick and astonished. Gabriel had explained the ram, goat, and little horn — but had **not** explained the 2,300 days.

**Read: Daniel 9:20-23**

> *"And whiles I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel... even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation, and he informed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding... therefore understand the matter, and consider the vision."* — Daniel 9:20-23

Gabriel returns — the same angel from Daniel 8:16 — to explain "the vision." **Which vision?** The one left unexplained — the 2,300 days from Daniel 8.

> *Ellen G. White:* "The angel had been sent to Daniel for the express purpose of explaining to him the point which he had failed to understand in the vision of the eighth chapter, the statement relative to time — 'unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.'" — *The Great Controversy*, p. 326

### The 70 Weeks: "Cut Off" from the 2,300 Days
**Read: Daniel 9:24**

> *"Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy."* — Daniel 9:24

- Hebrew *chatak* = "**cut off**" or "decreed." The word literally means to cut, to sever, to determine by cutting. This is its only occurrence in the Hebrew Old Testament.
- Cut off from what? The only larger time period under discussion: **the 2,300 days**
- The 70 weeks (490 years) form the **first portion** of the 2,300 years

**The 70 weeks and the 2,300 days share the same starting point.**

**The six objectives of the 70 weeks (Daniel 9:24):**

| Objective | Meaning | Fulfillment |
|---|---|---|
| "Finish the transgression" | End Israel's persistent rebellion | Israel's national rejection of the Messiah completed the transgression |
| "Make an end of sins" | Provide the ultimate sin offering | Christ's death on the cross (Hebrews 9:26; 10:12) |
| "Make reconciliation for iniquity" | Provide atonement | Christ's substitutionary death (Romans 5:10-11; 2 Corinthians 5:18-19) |
| "Bring in everlasting righteousness" | Establish permanent righteousness | Christ's perfect righteousness imputed to believers (Romans 3:21-22; 2 Corinthians 5:21) |
| "Seal up the vision and prophecy" | Validate the prophetic vision | The precise fulfillment of the 70 weeks confirms the entire 2,300-day vision |
| "Anoint the most Holy" | Inaugurate the heavenly sanctuary | Christ's inauguration of His heavenly ministry after His ascension (Hebrews 9:11-12, 24) |

### The Starting Point: 457 B.C.
**Read: Daniel 9:25**

> *"Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times."* — Daniel 9:25

The decree to "restore and build Jerusalem" was issued by **Artaxerxes I in 457 B.C.** (Ezra 7:12-26).

**Why this decree and not earlier ones?**

| Decree | Date | Issued By | Scripture | Scope |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| First | 536 B.C. | Cyrus | Ezra 1:1-4; 2 Chronicles 36:22-23 | Temple rebuilding only |
| Second | 519 B.C. | Darius I | Ezra 6:1-12 | Reaffirmed temple completion |
| **Third** | **457 B.C.** | **Artaxerxes I** | **Ezra 7:12-26** | **Full restoration of city, civil law, judicial functions, and self-governance** |
| Fourth | 444 B.C. | Artaxerxes I | Nehemiah 2:1-8 | Wall repair (supplemental, not the foundational decree) |

Only Artaxerxes' 457 B.C. decree authorized the **full restoration** of Jerusalem's civil and judicial governance, including the right to appoint magistrates and judges and to execute the law (Ezra 7:25-26).

**Historical confirmation of the 457 B.C. date:**
- **Ptolemy's Canon** (2nd century A.D.) — The astronomical dating system places the 7th year of Artaxerxes at 457 B.C.
- **The Elephantine Papyri** (discovered in Egypt, 1903) — These Aramaic documents from a Jewish colony confirm the chronology of the Persian kings and support the 457 B.C. date.
- **Greek historian Thucydides** — His references to Persian kings corroborate the timeline.
- **Olympiad dating** — Cross-references to Greek Olympic records confirm the accession of Artaxerxes I in 464 B.C. (his 7th year = 457 B.C.).

> *Ellen G. White:* "In the seventh chapter of Ezra the decree is found. In its completest form it was issued by Artaxerxes, king of Persia, 457 B.C. But in Ezra 6:14 the house of the Lord at Jerusalem is said to have been built 'according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.' These three kings, in originating, reaffirming, and completing the decree, brought it to the perfection required by the prophecy to mark the beginning of the 2300 years." — *Prophets and Kings*, p. 572

```

### Segment 1: Seven Weeks (49 years) — 457 B.C. to 408 B.C.

> *"The street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times."* — Daniel 9:25

The rebuilding of Jerusalem "in troublous times" (Daniel 9:25). The reconstruction of the city walls and streets was completed by approximately 408 B.C., as confirmed by the books of Ezra and Nehemiah.

**Scripture:** Nehemiah 4:7-9, 15-23 — The opposition from Sanballat, Tobiah, and the Arabs during the rebuilding exemplifies the "troublous times." Nehemiah 6:15 — The wall was completed in 52 days, but full restoration of the city continued.

**Historical note:** The Jewish Talmud (Seder Olam Rabbah, c. 160 A.D.) confirms that prophetic activity ceased in Israel around this same period with the death of the last prophets (Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi), concluding the first segment.

> *Ellen G. White:* "The restoration of Jerusalem and the rebuilding of the temple and its services were to be accomplished within the period of the first seven weeks, or forty-nine years. This work was carried forward amid the distressing times of which Nehemiah and Ezra testify." — *Christ in His Sanctuary*, p. 37

### Segment 2: Sixty-Two Weeks (434 years) — 408 B.C. to A.D. 27

> *"Unto the Messiah the Prince"* — Daniel 9:25

- 7 weeks + 62 weeks = 69 weeks = **483 years**
- 457 B.C. + 483 years = **A.D. 27** (no year zero)

**What happened in A.D. 27?**

> *"Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened, and the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased."* — Luke 3:21-22

> *"Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel."* — Mark 1:14-15

Jesus was baptized and anointed by the Holy Spirit — fulfilling "Messiah" (Hebrew: *Mashiach*) and "Christ" (Greek: *Christos*), both meaning "The Anointed One." When Jesus declared "**The time is fulfilled**," He was pointing to the fulfillment of Daniel's prophecy.

**Historical confirmation:**
- **Luke 3:1** — *"Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar..."* Tiberius began his co-regency in A.D. 12; his 15th year = A.D. 27.
- **John 2:20** — *"Forty and six years was this temple in building."* Herod began temple renovations in 20/19 B.C. + 46 years = A.D. 27.

> *Ellen G. White:* "At the time appointed — in the midst of the last week — Messiah was to be 'cut off.' In the spring of A.D. 31, Christ, the true Sacrifice, was offered on Calvary... The seventy weeks, or 490 years, especially allotted to the Jews, ended, as we have seen, in A.D. 34." — *The Great Controversy*, pp. 327-328

**This stunning fulfillment validates 457 B.C. as the correct starting date.**

### Segment 3: One Week (7 years) — A.D. 27 to A.D. 34

**Read: Daniel 9:26-27**

> *"And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself... And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease."* — Daniel 9:26-27

**"In the midst of the week" — A.D. 27 + 3.5 years = A.D. 31 (spring)**

- Jesus was crucified — "cut off, but not for Himself" — He died for the sins of the world (Isaiah 53:5-8; 1 Peter 2:24; 1 John 2:2)
- The veil of the temple was torn from top to bottom (Matthew 27:51; Mark 15:38)
- The earthly sacrificial system met its fulfillment (Hebrews 10:1-10)
- "He shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease" — not by decree, but by fulfillment. Christ was the Lamb of God (John 1:29)

> *"And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent."* — Matthew 27:51

> *Ellen G. White:* "In the midst of the week He shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease. In A.D. 31, three and a half years after His baptism, our Lord was crucified. With the great sacrifice offered upon Calvary, ended that system of offerings which for four thousand years had pointed forward to the Lamb of God." — *The Great Controversy*, p. 327

**Historical note:** The date of Christ's crucifixion in A.D. 31 is confirmed by astronomical calculations. Passover (14 Nisan) fell on a Friday in A.D. 31, consistent with the Gospel accounts (Matthew 27:62; Mark 15:42; Luke 23:54; John 19:31, 42). Sir Isaac Newton also calculated this date in his *Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel* (1733).

**End of the 70th week — A.D. 31 + 3.5 years = A.D. 34**

> *"And they stoned Stephen... And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him. As for Saul, he made havock of the church... Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word."* — Acts 7:59; 8:2-4

- Stephen was stoned (Acts 7:54-60) — the first Christian martyr
- Saul of Tarsus (later the apostle Paul) was converted shortly after (Acts 9:1-19)
- Philip preached in Samaria (Acts 8:5-8) and to the Ethiopian eunuch (Acts 8:26-39)
- Peter was sent to Cornelius the Gentile (Acts 10)
- The 490-year probationary period for the Jewish nation ended
- The gospel commission went to "all nations" (Matthew 28:19-20)

> *Ellen G. White:* "The stoning of Stephen and the persecution that followed convinced many that the Jewish leaders would never accept the gospel. Saul of Tarsus was one of those who seemed destined always to remain a bitter enemy of the church." — *The Acts of the Apostles*, p. 101

## PART 5: THE TERMINUS — 1844 AND THE CLEANSING OF THE SANCTUARY

### The Calculation

```
    457 B.C. + 2,300 years = A.D. 1844
```

> *"Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed."* — Daniel 8:14

### What Sanctuary?
The earthly temple was destroyed in A.D. 70 — long before 1844. The sanctuary cleansed in 1844 must be **the heavenly sanctuary**.

**Key texts on the heavenly sanctuary:**

| Reference | Full Text (KJV) |
|---|---|
| **Hebrews 8:1-2** | *"We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens; a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man."* |
| **Hebrews 9:11-12** | *"But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands... by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us."* |
| **Hebrews 9:23-24** | *"It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us."* |
| **Hebrews 8:5** | *"Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount."* (cf. Exodus 25:9, 40) |
| **Revelation 11:19** | *"And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail."* |
| **Revelation 8:3-4** | *"And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne."* |
| **Revelation 4:5** | *"And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God."* (cf. the lampstand in the earthly sanctuary) |

> *Ellen G. White:* "The subject of the sanctuary was the key which unlocked the mystery of the disappointment of 1844. It opened to view a complete system of truth, connected and harmonious, showing that God's hand had directed the great advent movement." — *The Great Controversy*, p. 423

### What Does "Cleansing" Mean?
Understanding requires studying the **Day of Atonement** (Yom Kippur) — Leviticus 16.

**The Earthly Day of Atonement:**

> *"And this shall be a statute for ever unto you: that in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict your souls, and do no work at all... For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before the LORD."* — Leviticus 16:29-30

- Occurred once a year — 10th day of the 7th month (Tishri) — Leviticus 16:29; 23:27
- A day of **judgment** — anyone not afflicting his soul was "cut off" (Leviticus 23:29)
- The high priest entered the Most Holy Place for the only time all year (Leviticus 16:2, 15-17)
- Blood sprinkled on the mercy seat — cover of the Ark containing the Ten Commandments (Leviticus 16:14-15; Exodus 25:21-22)
- The sanctuary was cleansed from accumulated sins transferred throughout the year through the daily sacrifices (Leviticus 16:16, 19, 30, 33)
- Sins placed on the scapegoat (*azazel*) — led into the wilderness (Leviticus 16:20-22) — a symbol of Satan ultimately bearing responsibility for sin

> *Ellen G. White:* "As in the typical service there was a work of atonement at the close of the year, so before Christ's work for the redemption of men is completed there is a work of atonement for the removal of sin from the sanctuary. This is the service which began when the 2300 days ended. At that time, as foretold by Daniel the prophet, our High Priest entered the most holy, to perform the last division of His solemn work — to cleanse the sanctuary." — *The Great Controversy*, p. 421

**The Antitype — The Heavenly Day of Atonement (Beginning 1844):**

1. **Christ entering the Most Holy Place** of the heavenly sanctuary to begin the **investigative judgment** (Daniel 7:9-10; Hebrews 9:23-24)
2. **Examination of the records** — the "books" of Daniel 7:10; Revelation 20:12; Malachi 3:16
3. **Vindication of God's character** — demonstrating before the watching universe that God is just (Romans 3:4, 26; Psalm 51:4)
4. **Blotting out of sins** for those found in Christ (Acts 3:19-20; Isaiah 43:25; 44:22)

> *"Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord."* — Acts 3:19

> *Ellen G. White:* "As the books of record are opened in the judgment, the lives of all who have believed on Jesus come in review before God. Beginning with those who first lived upon the earth, our Advocate presents the cases of each successive generation, and closes with the living." — *The Great Controversy*, p. 483

---

## PART 6: DANIEL 7 — THE JUDGMENT SCENE

Daniel 8's cleansing of the sanctuary is paralleled and expanded in the judgment scene of Daniel 7.

**Read: Daniel 7:9-10, 13-14**

> *"I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened."* — Daniel 7:9-10

> *"I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him. And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed."* — Daniel 7:13-14

**Key observations:**
- This is a **pre-Advent judgment** — before Christ's second coming
- The Son of Man comes **to the Ancient of Days** (the Father) — not to earth
- Occurs after the little horn's 1,260 years (A.D. 538-1798) and before the saints receive the kingdom (Daniel 7:21-22, 26-27)
- **Books are opened** — indicating investigation of records (cf. Malachi 3:16; Revelation 20:12; Ecclesiastes 12:14; Matthew 12:36-37)
- **Result:** The Son of Man receives "dominion, and glory, and a kingdom" (Daniel 7:14)

**Additional judgment scriptures:**
- **Ecclesiastes 12:14** — *"For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil."*
- **Matthew 12:36-37** — *"Every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned."*
- **2 Corinthians 5:10** — *"For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body."*
- **1 Peter 4:17** — *"For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God."*

**This perfectly parallels Daniel 8:14 — the judgment beginning in 1844.**

> *Ellen G. White:* "The coming of Christ as our high priest to the most holy place, for the cleansing of the sanctuary, brought to view in Daniel 8:14; the coming of the Son of man to the Ancient of Days, as presented in Daniel 7:13; and the coming of the Lord to His temple, foretold by Malachi, are descriptions of the same event." — *The Great Controversy*, p. 426

---

## PART 7: THE THREE ANGELS' MESSAGES — THE PROCLAMATION

The investigative judgment beginning in 1844 is directly connected to the first angel's message of Revelation 14.

**Read: Revelation 14:6-12**

> *"And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters."* — Revelation 14:6-7

> *"And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication."* — Revelation 14:8

> *"And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God... Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."* — Revelation 14:9-10, 12

| Angel | Message | Scripture | Significance |
|---|---|---|---|
| **First** | The everlasting gospel; the hour of judgment **has come**; worship the Creator | Rev. 14:6-7; cf. Exodus 20:8-11 | Call to Sabbath observance — echoes the 4th commandment's creation language |
| **Second** | Babylon is fallen | Rev. 14:8; cf. Rev. 18:1-4 | Apostate religious systems have rejected truth; God calls His people out (Rev. 18:4) |
| **Third** | Warning against the mark of the beast | Rev. 14:9-12; cf. Rev. 13:15-17 | Solemn warning about false worship; the saints keep God's commandments and the faith of Jesus |

**Historical context:** The Millerite movement (1830s-1844) proclaimed the first angel's message. William Miller, a Baptist preacher, studied Daniel 8:14 and arrived at the 1844 date. After the Great Disappointment of October 22, 1844 (when Christ did not return as expected), careful Bible study revealed that the event was not Christ's second coming but the beginning of His ministry in the Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary.

> *Ellen G. White:* "The message of Revelation 14, proclaiming that the hour of God's judgment is come, is given in the time of the end; and the angel of Revelation 10 is represented as having one foot on the sea and one foot on the land, showing that the message will be carried to distant lands, the ocean will be crossed, and the islands of the sea will hear the proclamation of the last message of warning to be given to the world." — *Testimonies for the Church*, vol. 9, p. 62

These messages define the **mission and identity** of the Seventh-day Adventist Church as a prophetic movement raised up by God in the context of the 1844 judgment.

---

## PART 8: PRACTICAL AND SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE

### 1. Christ Is Our High Priest — Now

> *"Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession. For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need."* — Hebrews 4:14-16

> *"Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them."* — Hebrews 7:25

Christ is not distant. He is actively ministering on our behalf in the heavenly sanctuary.

> *Ellen G. White:* "Jesus stands in the holy of holies, now to appear in the presence of God for us. There He ceases not to present His people moment by moment, complete in Himself." — *The Faith I Live By*, p. 205

### 2. We Are Living in the Antitypical Day of Atonement

The ancient Israelites treated the Day of Atonement with utmost solemnity — searching their hearts, confessing sin, and afflicting their souls (Leviticus 23:27-29). How much more should we, living in the great antitypical Day of Atonement, examine our lives, confess known sin, and surrender fully to Christ?

> *"Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord."* — Acts 3:19

> *"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."* — 1 John 1:9

> *"Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: and see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting."* — Psalm 139:23-24

> *Ellen G. White:* "Now, while our great High Priest is making the atonement for us, we should seek to become perfect in Christ. Not even by a thought could our Saviour be brought to yield to the power of temptation... This is the condition in which those must be found who shall stand in the time of trouble." — *The Great Controversy*, p. 623

### 3. The Judgment Vindicates God and His People

The investigative judgment is **not a cause for fear** for those who are in Christ. It is the process by which God demonstrates that His grace is sufficient, that Christ's sacrifice is effective, and that those who have accepted Him are truly His.

> *"There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."* — Romans 8:1

> *"Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us."* — Romans 8:33-34

> *Ellen G. White:* "While Jesus is pleading for the subjects of His grace, Satan accuses them before God as transgressors... But their Advocate pleads the merits of His own blood." — *The Great Controversy*, p. 484

### 4. Prophecy Confirms Our Faith

The precise fulfillment of the 70-week prophecy — the baptism of Christ in A.D. 27, His crucifixion in A.D. 31, and the gospel going to the Gentiles in A.D. 34 — provides overwhelming evidence that the Bible is divinely inspired. **If the first 490 years were fulfilled with pinpoint accuracy, the terminus in 1844 is equally reliable.**

> *"We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place."* — 2 Peter 1:19

### 5. We Have a Present-Truth Message

The three angels' messages are not relics of 1844. They are **present truth** — God's message for this hour of earth's history.

> *Ellen G. White:* "In a special sense Seventh-day Adventists have been set in the world as watchmen and light bearers. To them has been entrusted the last warning for a perishing world. On them is shining wonderful light from the Word of God. They have been given a work of the most solemn import — the proclamation of the first, second, and third angels' messages." — *Testimonies for the Church*, vol. 9, p. 19

## PART 9: COMMON OBJECTIONS AND RESPONSES

### Objection 1: "The 2,300 days are literal days, not years."
**Response:** Literal days (~6.3 years) cannot account for a vision spanning Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome — centuries of history. The year-day principle is biblically established (Numbers 14:34; Ezekiel 4:6). The term *ereb boqer* ("evenings-mornings") ties to the sanctuary cycle and creation language. Gabriel himself says the vision is for "the time of the end" (Daniel 8:17, 19) and "many days" (Daniel 8:26).

### Objection 2: "The sanctuary was Antiochus Epiphanes' desecration."
**Response:** Antiochus IV does not fulfill the prophecy because:
1. He was a minor king, not "exceeding great" — far less powerful than Medo-Persia or Greece (Daniel 8:4, 8 vs. 9)
2. His desecration lasted ~3 years (167-164 B.C.), not 2,300 years
3. Gabriel says the vision is for "the time of the end" (Daniel 8:17, 19) — not the 2nd century B.C.
4. The little horn grows after the four horns — historically, Rome succeeded the divided Greek Empire
5. The "Prince of the host" (Daniel 8:11) fits Christ, not a Jewish priest (cf. Joshua 5:14-15; Hebrews 2:10)
6. **Historical note:** The Antiochus interpretation was popularized by the pagan philosopher Porphyry (3rd century A.D.) to undermine the prophetic authority of Daniel. Jerome refuted this interpretation in his *Commentary on Daniel* (c. 407 A.D.).

### Objection 3: "Daniel 9 is not connected to Daniel 8."
**Response:** The Hebrew *chatak* ("cut off") implies cutting from a larger whole — its only occurrence in the Old Testament. Gabriel explicitly references a prior vision he was sent to explain (Daniel 9:21-23; cf. 8:16, 26-27). The unexplained element of Daniel 8 was the time prophecy. Thematic continuity — sanctuary, Messiah, time, judgment — binds the chapters inseparably. The phrase "understand the matter, and consider the vision" (Daniel 9:23) uses the same Hebrew word for "vision" (*mareh*) as Daniel 8:26.

### Objection 4: "There is no heavenly sanctuary."
**Response:** The book of Hebrews is built on the reality of the heavenly sanctuary (8:1-5; 9:11, 23-24). Revelation depicts the heavenly temple with altar of incense (8:3-4), lampstands (1:12), and Ark of the Covenant (11:19). God Himself commanded Moses to build the earthly sanctuary "according to the pattern" shown on the mountain (Exodus 25:9, 40; Hebrews 8:5). The earthly was always a "copy and shadow" of the heavenly reality.

## CONCLUSION

The 2,300-day prophecy is the **longest time prophecy in the Bible**, and its fulfillment marks the opening of the final phase of Christ's heavenly ministry — the investigative judgment. Rooted firmly in Scripture, validated by the precise fulfillment of the 70-week prophecy, and proclaimed in the three angels' messages, this prophecy gives Seventh-day Adventists their identity, mission, and urgency.

We serve a risen Savior who is even now interceding for us in the Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary. The judgment is not something to fear but to embrace, for it reveals a God who is meticulous in His justice and lavish in His grace.

> *Ellen G. White:* "We are now living in the great day of atonement. In the typical service, while the high priest was making the atonement for Israel, all were required to afflict their souls by repentance of sin and humiliation before the Lord, lest they be cut off from among the people. In like manner, all who would have their names retained in the book of life should now, in the few remaining days of their probation, afflict their souls before God by sorrow for sin and true repentance." — *The Great Controversy*, p. 489
